# GrimoireML: An Educational Open-Source Hub for Machine Learning Exploration

<img src="https://github.com/PedroNunesPagnussat/GrimoireML/blob/a2f0a5d8fd47ec7734ea2e581f3f4a4e328a2140/imgs/logo.png" width="256">


GrimoireML is an open-source project specifically designed for educational exploration in the field of machine learning and data science. Our goal is to implement and understand the underlying mechanics of machine learning by providing a platform where algorithms are implemented from the ground up, using only mathematical operations.

Important Note: Not for Production Use
GrimoireML is crafted exclusively for educational and experimental purposes. It is not optimized for performance or scalability and should not be used in production environments.

Who is it for?
Math Enthusiasts: If you've ever wondered how machine learning algorithms work at their core, GrimoireML is your playground.
Learners: Ideal for students, educators, or anyone looking to gain a fundamental understanding of machine learning through mathematics.


## Installation

You can clone the repository and install GrimoireML locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PedroNunesPagnussat/GrimoireML
```

The source code is located at GrimoireML/grimoireml/src

## Importing

```python
import grimoireml as gml

# Now you can use the 'gml' alias to access GrimoireML's functions and classes
```
Note: this can only be used in the same directory

## Acknowledgements

To my Professor Lucas Silveira Kupssinsku and my classmates how helped with the math concepts 

### Inspiration

GrimoireML draws heavy inspiration from well-established machine learning libraries such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The design principles, algorithms, and overall approach are influenced by these pioneering projects. We encourage users to explore these libraries as well, and we express our gratitude to the developers and contributors of scikit-learn and TensorFlow for their work in the field of machine learning.
